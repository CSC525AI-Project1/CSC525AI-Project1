# CSC525AI-Project1
This is the first group project for CSC 525 Artificial Intelligence.  The professor supplied 4 files with starter code. 
It is an 8 puzzle game on a 3x3 grid, trying to move the numbers from the supplied start position to the desired end position.
We start with the uninformedSearch, which is a breath first search with a list of closed states.  From there we do several
informed searches, and for bonus points we create our own search heuristic.
